        In my design code I have used separate div for the logo of website so that it becomes easy for each and every type of screen to display it properly. Navigation bar is designed in a way so that it remains as it is in a full screen site even if opened in small screen. In very small screen navigation bar adjust itself by sending on of the button in bottom. I set the width of each list item so that they all get adjusted in 100% of width of the navigation bar. After that, I used unordered list again to display all products so that they get aligned horizontally in big screen an as we decrease the width of screen they will be aligned vertically. This is the best way in my opinion to make things aligned automatically. Every product is in new unordered list so that they remain separated while displaying on big screen.
